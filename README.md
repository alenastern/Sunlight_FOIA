# Open data and FOIA requests

## Background
We have often said that opening data has the potential to reduce the number of public-records requests. (In many states, these requests are made under a law called the “Freedom of Information Act,” or FOIA, but some states use other names.) But we don’t have a lot of evidence to back this up, only intuition. In particular, one question we have also wondered is if there is a possibility that releasing more data publicly can result in getting a subsequent increase in requests that are sparked by the contents of the data that has been released.

## Research Questions
This research aims to answer the following questions:
1. When cities establish a policy or portal do they see a subsequent decline in the number of public records requests? 
2. How do the records requests or requesters change after the portal/policy is passed?
3. In general, how does demand for public data change as cities adopt and expand open data policies and programs?
