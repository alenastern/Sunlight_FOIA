# Open data and FOIA requests

## Background
Last year 28 U.S. cities published open data policies, signaling a national move from reactive responses to public records requests to systematically and proactively publishing open data. For most of the last 50 years, Freedom of Information Laws (FOI) have ensured that residents have access to information on government activities as a fundamental, democratic right. But now that many of these cities are [“setting the default to open,”](https://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) city staff are left guessing about how to balance these two varying but equally crucial channels for public access to information. 

From a research perspective, the relationship between FOI laws and open data policies can be framed as: are the channels of open data and FOI law [competitors](http://theconversation.com/could-the-open-government-movement-shut-the-door-on-freedom-of-information-92724) or [complements](https://webfoundation.org/2015/08/freedom-of-information-and-open-government-data-communities-could-benefit-from-closer-collaboration/)? Understanding the relationship between open data and public records requests could help city staff better allocate internal resources to improving one channel or the other. City staff need to understand exactly when and why residents are still struggling to engage with public information and apply resources to improve the way both open data and FOI laws work.

## Research Questions
This research aims to answer the following questions:
1. Does adopting an open data policy affect the volume of public record requests that cities receive?  
2. Does the community of records requesters change over time?
3. Does the type of public records requested change following passage of an open data policy?
