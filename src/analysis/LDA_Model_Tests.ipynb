However, we still see some issues with the topics. Namely, we see that a considerable number PRRs that contain only a rare proper name (that was not included in our dictionary of proper names) were included in the training set, weakening our model results. We test a number of additional screening criteria for PRRs to include in our training set to see if they improve performance. Overall, we are looking for the criteria that provides the best model results while including the largest number of observations in the training set."
